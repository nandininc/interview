# Nandini N C

## Java Full Stack Developer

### Introduction
Hi, I'm Nandini N C. I'm a Java full stack developer with 2 years of experience at TechFortune.
I specialize in creating full-fledged applications with Spring Boot and React. 

In my current employment, I've worked on several projects. 
The major one was a Learning Management System built using React, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL database. 
It has multiple features like an admin dashboard for course and user management along with drag and drop blog builder modules. I also added security to the APIs using Spring Security libraries, with an interactive quiz system for students and mock tests.

I also worked on an online shopping application for product listing, adding items to cart and buying online where we implemented Razor Pay integration with persona management. I added an Admin dashboard with complete inventory management, sales analytics, and mail services.

I've created a responsive personal portfolio showcasing my development projects and skills which is currently live.

On the personal side, I'm from Hubli, Karnataka. I live with my widowed mother and two younger brothers. Currently, I stay in Koramangala 1st block.

## Project base questions:
### expalain about your projects?
1.hybridsystems
HybridSystems is a comprehensive e-commerce platform I developed using React for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. The application features a responsive product catalog with advanced search and filtering capabilities, a secure user authentication system, and a shopping cart with real-time updates. The admin dashboard provides complete product management functionality, inventory tracking, sales analytics, and automated invoice generation.

2.LMS project
The LMS platform is a full-stack educational application I developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot with PostgreSQL for the backend. This comprehensive platform facilitates online learning through various interactive features.
Key Technical Features:
Multi-role Authentication System: Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (Admin, Instructor, Student) to manage permissions securely.
Dynamic Content Management: Created a robust course management system allowing instructors to upload, organize, and manage various content types (videos, PDFs, quizzes).
Interactive Quiz Module: Developed a flexible quiz system supporting multiple question types (MCQs, short answers) with automatic evaluation and instant feedback.
Admin Dashboard: Built an intuitive administrative interface for comprehensive platform management, including user accounts, course approvals, and content moderation.
Drag-and-Drop Blog Builder: Implemented a custom drag-and-drop interface allowing instructors to create rich course content without technical knowledge.
Student Progress Tracking: Design need a system to track and visualize student progress, completion rates, and assessment performance. 

### Why are you leaving your current organization?
Sir, currently there is no much development going on and i can't see much carrier growth as well so im looking for a change.

### what is your salary exceptions?
sir currently am getting 3lpa iam expecting around 4.5 to 5 lpa

### what is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured so that systems can exchange data


### Type of API's
APIs can be RESTful (following REST architecture) or SOAP-based, and they can return data in formats like JSON or XML.

### Different API methods
APIs support different methods (also called HTTP methods) to interact with resources. Here are the common ones:

GET – Retrieves data from the server.

POST – Sends new data to the server.

PUT – Updates an existing resource.

PATCH – Partially updates an existing resource.

DELETE – Removes a resource from the server.


### Difference between PUT and PATCH in APIs

PUT → Full update (Replaces existing resource).

PATCH → Partial update (Updates only specified fields).

### Frontend Optimization (React)
Lazy Loading & Code Splitting – Load components only when needed using React.lazy() and React Suspense.
Use React.memo & useCallback – Prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Optimize State Management – Use lightweight state management (React Context API, Redux Toolkit).
Reduce Bundle Size – Remove unused dependencies and minify assets.

### Backend Optimization (Spring Boot)
Enable Caching – Use Spring Cache with Redis to store frequently accessed data.
Optimize Database Queries – Use indexed queries, batch processing, and pagination.
Connection Pooling – Configure HikariCP for efficient database connection management.
Optimize API Responses – Reduce payload size, enable Gzip compression, and use DTOs instead of entities.
Asynchronous Processing – Use @Async for background tasks like email notifications and order processing.
Implement Rate Limiting – Protect APIs with Spring Security & Bucket4j.
