## Java Full Stack Developer

### Introduction
Hi, I'm Nandini N C. I'm a Java full stack developer with 2 years of experience at TechFortune.
I specialize in creating full-fledged applications with Spring Boot and React. 

In my current employment, I've worked on several projects. 
The major one was a Learning Management System built using React, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL database. 
It has multiple features like an admin dashboard for course and user management along with drag and drop blog builder modules. I also added security to the APIs using Spring Security libraries, with an interactive quiz system for students and mock tests.

I also worked on an online shopping application for product listing, adding items to cart and buying online where we implemented Razor Pay integration with persona management. I added an Admin dashboard with complete inventory management, sales analytics, and mail services.

I've created a responsive personal portfolio showcasing my development projects and skills which is currently live.

On the personal side, I'm from Hubli, Karnataka. I live with my widowed mother and two younger brothers. Currently, I stay in Koramangala 1st block.
